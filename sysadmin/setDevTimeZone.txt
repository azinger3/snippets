    so i think this "trick" works for all macs, if you work with dates and want to make sure the timezone conversions are "working" as expected, we have a couple different routes
​[11:46 AM] David Brooks
    a) change your local timezone (PITA)

    b) build docker and run via docker (all of our docker files set timezone to PST)

    c) for Macs, set the timezone on the command line: TZ='US/Pacific' node server.js
